## 😀 About me
I am a PhD student at the **University of Macau**, supervised by Prof. Chi-Man Pun and Prof. Qieshi Zhang. Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree from **Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences**. 

My research is at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Robotics**, with a core focus on **Visual Place Recognition (VPR)**. Now, I am particularly interested in developing robust, lightweight methods for autonomous navigation.


## 🔍 Research Interests
*   **Visual Place Recognition (VPR):** Lightweight feature extraction and distilled representation for large-scale scene recognition.
*   **Robust Perception:** Addressing viewpoint, seasonal, and weather changes using frequency domain analysis and attention mechanisms.
*   **Generative Features for VPR:** (Ongoing) Exploring Diffusion-based descriptors (DIFT) for localization tasks.


## 🎓 Education
*   **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, University of Macau, 2024 – Present
*   **M.Sc. in Computer Technology**, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) & SIAT, 2021 – 2024
*   **B.Tech. in Computer Science**, Dongguan University of Technology (DGUT), 2016 – 2020
